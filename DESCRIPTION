Description: (1) Computes score test statistics for testing whether a large number of
    coefficients (typically corresponding to genetic markers) in a GLM are zero in
    presence of a smaller number of covariates (typically environmental covariat) not
    included in the test, and provides estimates of correlations beween the test
    statistics, and (2) computes Glaz–Johnson-type intersection approximations of the
    asymptotic multivariate normal distribution of the test statistics. See Halle et al.,
    "Efficient and powerful familywise error control in genome-wide association studies
    using generalised linear models".
