Description: (1) Computes score test statistics for testing whether each of a large
    number of
    coefficients (typically corresponding to genetic markers) in a GLM is zero in
    presence of a smaller number of covariates (typically environmental covariates),
    and provides estimates of correlations between the test
    statistics, and (2) computes Glaz–Johnson-type intersection approximations of the
    asymptotic multivariate normal distribution of the test statistics, which can be
    used for FWER control. See Halle et al.,
    "Efficient and powerful familywise error control in genome-wide association studies
    using generalised linear models".
