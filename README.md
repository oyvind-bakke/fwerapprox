# fwerapprox

R package for

(1) computing score test statistics for testing whether a large number of coefficients (typically corresponding to genetic markers) in a GLM are zero in presence of a smaller number of covariates (typically environmental covariat) not included in the test, and estimation of correlations beween the test statistics, and

(2) computing Glazâ€“Johnson-type intersection approximations of the asymptotic multivariate normal distribution of the test statistics.

To install:

```r
