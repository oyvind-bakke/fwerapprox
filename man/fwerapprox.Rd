\title{The fwerapprox package}
\description{
(1) Computes score test statistics for testing whether a large number of
coefficients (typically corresponding to genetic markers) in a GLM are zero in
presence of a smaller number of covariates (typically environmental covariates) not
included in the test, and provides estimates of correlations between the test
statistics, and (2) computes Glazâ€“Johnson-type intersection approximations of the
asymptotic multivariate normal distribution of the test statistics. See Halle et al.,
"Efficient and powerful familywise error control in genome-wide association studies
using generalised linear models".

\section{Functions}{

\describe{
\item{\code{scorestatcorr}}{Computes score test statistics for testing whether each of a large number of
coefficients (typically corresponding to genetic markers) in a GLM with canonical
link is zero
in presence of a smaller number of covariates (typically environmental
covariates) not included in the test, and provides estimates of correlations
between the test statistics.}

\item{\code{gamma2}}{Computes a second-order Glaz--Johnson approximation to a multivariate
standard normal probability with a given correlation matrix. Gives a
familywise error rate level bound in multiple testing for a given local
(per-hypothesis) significance level.}

\item{\code{gamma_k}}{Computes an order \eqn{k} Glaz--Johnson approximation to a multivariate
standard normal probability with a given correlation matrix. Gives a familywise error rate level
bound in multiple testing for a given local (per-hypothesis) significance level.}
