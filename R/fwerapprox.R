#' The fwerapprox package
#'
#' (1) Computes score test statistics for testing whether a large number of
#' coefficients (typically corresponding to genetic markers) in a GLM are zero in
#' presence of a smaller number of covariates (typically environmental covariat) not
#' included in the test, and provides estimates of correlations beween the test
#' statistics, and (2) computes Glazâ€“Johnson-type intersection approximations of the
#' asymptotic multivariate normal distribution of the test statistics. See Halle et al.,
#' "Efficient and powerful familywise error control in genome-wide association studies
#' using generalised linear models".
